# Machine Learning Python Notebooks
My stab at machine learning in Python 3.7.7

Most of the inspiration for these notebooks are based on YouTube by [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg). Kudos to him for being such a good teacher!

## Requirements
The tutorials were all done in python using jupyterlab v2.1.2. 

Library packages used were:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* Pickle
* SKlearn
* Tensorflow
* Keras

Datasets were obtained from the [UCI machine repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) and from the SKlearn datasets library package.

## Contents
This machine learning repository will cover:

Supervised learning:
* Linear regression
* K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
* Support-vectors machine (SVM)
* Neural networks (CNN) on images

Unsupervised learning:
* K-Means clustering
