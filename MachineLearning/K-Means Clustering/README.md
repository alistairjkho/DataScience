# K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.

To put it simply: '*the objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.*'

# Folder contents

This folder consists of 3 python jupyter notebooks which explores the K-Means clustering machine learning algorithm.

The most comprehensive notebook is the '**K Means Clustering - TwTim.ipynb**', which is a tutorial based on the Tech With Tim's YouTube Channel which looks at predicting numbers 0 to 9 from an image dataset using K Means Clustering. The notebook will cover:

* Importing the data
* Fitting the model
* Training and scoring the model
* Evaluation of the model with metrics
* Validating the model's accuracy 

The notebook '**Tensorflow Attempt**' is an attempt to compare the same problem at predicting numbers from 0 to 9 using deep learning with Tensorflow machine learning package, to compare with the K-Means Clustering method.

The notebook '**K Means - IML Youtube.ipynb**' is a simple introduction into K means clustering from the Intuitive Machine Learning YouTube Channel, which looks at clustering of randomly generated data points visualised on a 2D dataset.
