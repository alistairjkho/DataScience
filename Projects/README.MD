## Coronavirus DataAnalysis

This project was inspired by this [Medium Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-the-coronavirus-pandemic-with-choropleth-maps-7f30fccaecf5).

The project explores a [coronavirus dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) from Kaggle to perform some simple interactive visualisations with the Plotly library package. The project covers
* Importing the data
* Cleaning and pre-processing the data 
* Heavily uses the plotly library package to plot interactive visualisation figures
	* Lineplots
	* Choropleth maps
	* Piecharts
	* Barcharts 
	* Treemap plots

## Customer Churn Analysis

Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. It is also the rate at which employees leave their jobs within a certain period. For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate (measured by the number of new customers) must exceed its churn rate.

This project investigates a dataset to predict behavior to retain customers. All relevant customer data were analysed and developed to focus on customer retention for the company.

## House Prices Advanced Regression

This is one of my biggest projects that I used to get myself familiar with data science, which is based off the famous Kaggle dataset that looks at predicting house prices. This notebook covers:

* Tips on how to get started on a data science project
* Exploratory data analysis
* Finding correlations of features to the target (label)
* Multivariate study (Numerical and categorical features)
* Data cleaning (Dropping/filling NA values)
* Feature engineering
* Encoding categorical features with get_dummies
* Outlier detection and removal
* Statistical analysis (skewness and kurtosis)
* Normalising data
* Pre-processing for machine learning
* Feature scaling
* Linear regression model
* Cross validating scoring
* Regularisation (Lasso and ridge)
* ElasticNET

## WebScraping

This folder contains basic beginner projects that explores some of the most common python libraries for webscraping such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
