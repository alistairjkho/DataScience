# DataScience Portfolio by Alistair Ho

This portfolio is a compilation of jupyter python notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithm which I used on my journey to learn Data Science.

I am passionate aboute data science as I love doing analysis on data, where the applications are vast and encapsulates nearly every industry to this day. Having an inquisitive mind and the satisfaction of solving problems are huge factors that motivate me to explore data science and I am excited to share my experiences over time on GitHub.

Having said that, I hope you do find these projects interesting!


# Resources

Most of my resources come from multiple sources:
* Medium - Towards Data Science
* YouTube - Tech with Tim, Ken Jee, Sentdex, Data Science Mojo, 3Blue1Brown, StatQuest with Josh Starmer
* CourseEra - Machine learning course with Andrew Ng
* eDx courses - Machine learning and python introduction
* Kaggle
* StackOverflow
* Reddit - /r/machinelearning, /r/datascience
* GitHub

I also try my best to cite sources in my notebooks in markdown, of where I have taken my inspiration from.
