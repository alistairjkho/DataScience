Bringing Ingenuity to Life

We’re an innovation and transformation consultancy that believes in the power of ingenuity to build a positive-human future in a technology-driven world. Our diverse teams of experts combine innovative thinking with breakthrough-technologies to progress further, faster.

Those that start using AI and advanced data analytics early will gain the most. While the technology is yet to live up to the hype, using it now gives a chance to get ahead, learn and improve to drive long-term value.

It’s essential to start with developing and deploying use cases and meanwhile building a capability around artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced data analytics. It’ll be a key differentiator in the short term, and a necessity in the long term.

We are hiring at all levels:
Data Scientists- Using our analytics expertise, we help our clients find hidden insights in mass data sets so you can plan more effective responses to tough challenges.
Data Engineers - Our data engineering and architecture expertise helps unlock our client’s data, opening doors to new business opportunities, optimal organisational performance and great user experience.
Data Architects - We’re experts in uncovering the real story buried in data. We are looking for data architects who know how the future data platforms look like and know how they interact with existing legacy clients’ architecture.
In recent projects our team have:
Analysed the blogosphere to identify influencers
Used voice and text analytics to predict customer sentiments and Net Promotor Scores
Created an internet of things trial for a FTSE 100 company
Used unstructured data to predict breaches in ethical behaviour of global organisations
Used deep learning to uncover optimal settings to make a pharmaceutical manufacturing process 15% more efficient
Analysed live audio data to create individual sound zones
Used neural networks to detect patterns in massive highly non-linear time-series.
Who do we want?
A degree, Masters or PhD from a leading university in mathematics, operational research, physics, finance and economics or computer science.
A genuine affinity for problem solving - an inquisitive mind who wants to solve the trickiest challenges whilst working with incredible colleagues.
Existing experience in consulting would be beneficial although we equally like in-house experience
Experience of conducting analysis for evidence based decision making, developing models and decision support tools or building business cases for investment decisions.
We work independently of any particular platform so we can provide unbiased client advice and choose the best approach for our clients
Existing experience in consulting would be beneficial although we equally like in-house experience
An inquisitive mind that wants to solve the trickiest challenges whilst working with incredible colleagues.
For senior candidates:
Experience of leading teams and developing people’s skills and capabilities.

WorldRemit is changing the way people send money internationally. We've taken something complicated and made it as simple as sending a text. And we're growing. Fast.

To do this, we need to hire bright people who can work autonomously and make the right decisions.

Who we're searching for...

We are looking for a Commercial Data Scientist that will support our data driven culture, leveraging the ever-expanding range of data sources we have available to improve our pricing decisions, from exploring our competitive landscape to understanding the way customers use our service.

You will be working with some of the most cutting-edge technologies and the most talented people in the industry. This will give you a great opportunity to develop your skills and progress your career in one of the fastest growing companies in Europe!

This is an amazing opportunity for a data driven individual to play a key role in the continued growth of one of the UK's leading FinTech companies; and a very exciting challenge to put analytical skills to the test against an international context.

Have you got what it takes?

As a Commercial Data Scientist, you will use your ability in SQL, R and/or Python to create analytically driven recommendations that shape pricing strategy and maximise ROI.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Applied Science based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

During the summer, we take the whole team on a 3-day retreat for vision-setting, aligning our goals, product management, and team-building. We’re not saying this involves beers, guitars, and songs by the campfire. But we’re not saying it doesn’t.

We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. We work hard while still having fun, being ourselves, hanging out together, and enjoying delicious snacks at the office.

Project Galileo : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Engineering and Product based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist – Causality Expert based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Born out of CERN and the University of Cambridge, we are tackling serious medical conditions with a mixture of machine learning and advanced statistical tools. Our team is composed of world experts in deep learning, cardiology, bioinformatics and data science.

Predictive analytics is the next frontier in medicine. Today, patients with chronic medical conditions suffer life-threatening disease complications without warning. Tomorrow, patients and healthcare providers will use Transformative tools to identify subtle physiologic changes that precede symptom onset, enabling personalised preparation and prevention.

Annually, 6 million people die of Sudden Cardiac Arrest. Yet, no available technology warns patients or healthcare providers of an oncoming arrest. We’re changing this. By using world-class AI and analysis techniques from CERN, we’ve developed an algorithm that predicts Sudden Cardiac Arrest, enabling lives to be saved.

RESPONSIBILITIES

In the first instance, your role will primarily involve working with the Transformative team on its ventricular tachyarrhythmia prediction algorithm as it is validated and further developed using a set of ten cardiac databases.

In the long term, your focus will be to create targeted models for well-defined conditions with highly detrimental acute outcomes. As a team, Transformative is developing artificially intelligent predictive monitoring services that avoid complications of a broad range of chronic medical conditions. The ultimate aim of our work will be to contribute to the transformation of the health system, ushering in an era of personalised prevention that creates better health, improves patient experience, and lowers the unnecessary costs of disease complications.

Lead Data Scientist,-1,"Bloom & Wild is re-inventing the $60B global flower industry. Over a billion flower exchanges take place every year and industry satisfaction levels are low. We are using technology and data science to build the world’s leading and most loved flower company. We’ve seen impressive traction to date - we are Europe’s largest direct to consumer flower company, are growing at 100% year on year and are in a strong position financially (and have been extremely fortunate to see growth remain strong during the Covid-19 crisis).

We’ve raised multiple rounds of venture capital and private equity funding, have been named one of the 5 fastest growing tech companies in Europe and are alumni of Tech Nation’s Future Fifty. We were also one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020.

See more on what it's like to work at Bloom & Wild here.

Data science at Bloom & Wild

The overall Bloom & Wild team is now over 100 people. Data Science sits within our tech and product organisation and collaborates closely with product managers, business intelligence analysts (separate team), back-end engineers and our CRM and operations teams. We are growing our existing team of 3 data scientists to a team of 5 or 6 over the coming months, with the Data Science Lead leading this team’s work as a “player-coach” figure. We have a large and growing dataset to manage, with millions of customers and hundreds of thousands of monthly transactions

The focus of the Data Science team is on

Building out our Bloom & Wild bespoke recommendation engine (we have to address particular complexities here, such as having a perishable product with a slower replenishment cycle than consumption cycle and having user preferences that are dynamic depending on the gift recipient and the purchase occasion - dimensions about which we have varying and imperfect information to drive decisions)
Driving our use of marketing and promotional strategies to balance out supply and demand at an aggregate and individual (user and item) level
Using AI tools to improve our end to end operational processes, from demand forecasting, to optimising operations in our recently launched fulfilment centre, to optimising delivery schedules in conjunction with carrier partners
Exploring opportunities to build out a recommendation-as-a-service API with a view to rolling this out across further categories as our business expands, and ultimately to commercialising this for 3rd parties

The role and ways of working

Reporting to our VP, Product, Retention and Data, you will lead the delivery of team projects as both an individual contributor but also as a coach/mentor/manager to other data scientists
You’ll take the lead on advising the business on which data to collect and how to store and manage it to provide the datasets for future data science projects. We’re primarily working in Python with AWS databases (Postgres RDS, Redshift and DynamoDB) and we’ve recently implemented Snowflake.
You’ll constantly look to automate the routine to spend your and your team’s time on problems that add value to our business

This role will expand your abilities through working alongside our wealth of specialist data scientists and software engineers on various projects, from rapidly prototyped research right through to high grade enterprise systems.

Roke delivers advanced research, development services and products and is a vendor neutral supplier picking the most appropriate technologies to achieve the required performance and capabilities. Roke staffs its teams with the most appropriate individuals, although it’s rare to have nothing new to learn on a project so an enthusiasm to learn and adapt to new technical challenges is vital for this role.

Many of our projects are highly creative, so we are looking for individuals who have the ability to think around and propose solutions to problems. All our data scientists need to communicate to a high standard and work effectively in multi-skilled teams, so good written and verbal communication skills are fundamental.

Applicants who would prefer more flexible working arrangements, such as reduced hours, would be welcome to apply for this role.

What will your role look like?

You will be developing data science solutions within one or more of our client side teams. If you have the experience, you could also provide technical leadership to junior members of staff and interact with stakeholders during the development cycle.

Our data analytics work encompasses all types of data, including structured and unstructured data (such as text and image). Projects vary greatly depending on the customer and their requirements. We use a variety of software, picking the best approach to suit the customers’ needs. For example, you might exploit your software expertise to solve big data or data streaming challenges using open source technologies. Alternatively, you might use your statistical background to develop machine learned models to classify data. Or, perhaps you will specialise in data visualisation techniques in order to enable our customers to easily access the required information from their data.

Most projects will require some data cleansing and transformation, so you should be comfortable with standard data pre-processing techniques.

Location can vary and should your role require you to attend client sites, you will be encouraged to spend a proportion of your time at our Roke base site (London) contributing to the Rokes technical innovation and data science community.

What do we need from you?

You will ideally hold a degree qualification in computer science, software engineering, data science, mathematics, physics or similar. Alternatively you will have similar experience/education to an equivalent level. You will be an enthusiastic software engineer and will also have experience of multiple programming languages with a passion for high-quality, eligible and maintainable code.

You will have data science expertise; however, as this is such a broad area we would consider experience in a subset of any of the following:
Large scale (‘big data’) data ecosystems, cloud infrastructure and analytic frameworks.
Machine learning and Deep Neural Net technologies
Techniques and toolkits for data cleansing, data preparation, data processing, fusion and analysis
Techniques and toolkits for combining data or analysing data streams in real time
Programming languages and techniques for visualising data
You will be comfortable working side by side with product managers, designers, and clients, making decisions together in order to quickly deliver valuable working software to clients and their users.

You enjoy growing your skills and those of your team and you regularly learn about new technologies. Most importantly, you judge your achievements by the success and happiness of your team and its customers.

As an effective communicator you will have experience consulting or teaching and enjoy mentoring junior developers, helping them push their boundaries and abilities. You value transparency and continuous improvement in your development team.

Roke also operates in the fields of network communications, network connectivity, autonomy and cyber and your familiarity with underpinning concepts in one or more of these areas would be beneficial.

Why should you work with us?

We offer you a competitive salary and benefits package including:
A substantial performance related bonus scheme, which we accompany with a clearly defined and fair review process.

Research Fellow (Data Scientist),-1,"There are two posts available, both full time working 35 hours per week. One is permanent, and one is fixed term until November 2022.

The University of Westminster has been engaged in air transport research, consultancy and teaching for over 40 years. The air traffic management team is located within the School of Architecture and Cities, based at our Marylebone campus, in central London. Air traffic management has been a core area of research for over 20 years, with a very strong international reputation and with particular emphases on economics, operations, data analysis, modelling and performance. Following several successful H2020 project bids, we are now looking to expand this research area through the appointment of two Research Fellows.

The postholders will work on these new projects with the air traffic management team, led by Professor Andrew Cook. The position requires individual and collaborative research, contributions to research bids, co-authored publication work and activities to promote impact and extend the team’s research portfolio, with a high standard of written and spoken English.

The postholders will need to demonstrate skills and experience in data analysis, optimisation methods, and a range of machine learning algorithms and applications (such as predictive analytics and data mining/classification). Previous experience of analytical modelling and good numerical modelling skills (e.g. network simulation) must be demonstrated. (Knowledge of ensemble learning and of stochastic modelling would be an advantage.)

The position requires the ability to work efficiently with high volumes of data, with experience of data cleaning, data fusion, and data storage/management. (Knowledge of NoSQL databases and secure data frames would be an advantage).

Candidates from disciplines outside the field of transport will be considered. Work in our team often draws on complex network metrics and measures of causality. Experience of European air traffic management principles and flight trajectory optimisation would be an advantage. The former must otherwise be acquired, with team support, in post.

Shortlisted candidates will be contacted by e-mail by 30 July 2020 regarding interviews.

Due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, interviews will be conducted remotely, on 12 August 2020. Shortlisted candidates will be required to make a short, technical presentation as part of their interview, on a topic to be notified on shortlisting. The interview technical arrangements will be agreed in advance with the candidate (probably Skype). The successful candidate would start ASAP thereafter.

It is likely that the initial period in post would be undertaken remotely, until such time as government guidance advises on the safety of the lifting of current restrictions. The ATM team uses remote tools extensively for its research collaborations in any case, such that issues are not foreseen with the postholders initially working remotely. No special tools are required.

To apply for this vacancy please click above. Further information can be found in the job description and person specification, which can be accessed through link below.

Closing date: midnight on 23 July 2020

These roles are free of line management requirements and so will be especially suited to applicants who are keen on having space to carry out analysis themselves.

At the Institute you will be expected to operate with a high degree of autonomy, championing the effective use of data and analytical evidence across the Institute. This will require a clear understanding of quality assurance, risk and project management to ensure successful delivery across the full range of your responsibilities.

We value the flexibility to pick up slack across other areas of capability as well as expertise and specialization.

Collaboration: We find that diverse groups working together come to better solutions. In user testing this approach builds empathy in the team. In design we collaborate to test ideas and develop alternatives. As a team we work together to improve our approach.

Continuous learning: This applies to product development as it applies to individuals. Our projects are designed to engage with uncertainty creating opportunities to learn. We use experiments, prototypes and hypotheses to learn about user behaviour, design algorithms and select technologies. Our communities of practice provide a space for us to improve and learn from peers. While as individuals a personal training budget enables opportunity to grow and develop.

Outcome Focus: When driving our projects we focus on outcomes. Knowing how a project will be deemed a success by users and customers enables creativity and innovation.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Director of Applied Data Science - Financial Services based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Leading initiatives to locate, catalogue and, where appropriate, integrate data sets.
Managing relationships with key internal and external stakeholders, including building and maintaining strategic relationships with universities and other regulatory or government bodies active in the management and use of data.
Working with the Director, Data Innovation and other senior members of the Hub to set, realise and review its strategic direction.
Working with our People and Transformation Team to promote and deliver specialist training to data professionals and, more generally, to improve the capability of all colleagues in the organisation to use data.
Working with our ICT team to ensure that the Hub’s activities are aligned with the ICT Strategy.
Reviewing and evolving our policy for Open Data and working with our Public Policy Team to explore and implement efficient and secure ways to share data with governments and other policy makers.
Developing a strategy for, and subsequently leading, the efficient, secure and sustainable sharing of data with external organisations through mechanisms such as application programming interfaces (APIs).

About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:
Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

Locations

We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.

Coming from outside the UK?

In order to live and work as a Biomedical Scientist in the United Kingdom; there are two essential legal requirements:

(1) You must hold valid HCPC registration to be employed as a Biomedical Scientist in the UK - this is a legal requirement as this is a 'protected title'.
Employers are very unlikely to consider an applicant who is either not registered or in the final stage of registration.
For information on registration with the HCPC click HERE.

(2) If you hold a non-European Economic Area (EEA) passport not endorsed with permission to undertake employment you would need to explore your options with regard to eligibility to undertake employment in the United Kingdom.
Some UK employers may be able to offer non-EEA nationals a Certificate of Sponsorship (work permit) but this is a complex and expensive process for employers, so opportunities will vary.
